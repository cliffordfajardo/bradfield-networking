# Ping

# Motivation
This module implements a basic version of the `ping` command which uses `ICMP` protocol.
I decided to implement a basic version of `ping` first, since it's a smaller scoped program, before
diving into builing my implementation of `traceroute`, which is similar to `ping`, but it does more
like counting the # of hops between my desitination and reporting it back to me, whereas ping doesn't
include the # of hops to my destination.

# Concerning the `raw-sockets` module.
Currently nodejs doesnt provide support for accessing raw sockets, only datagram and stream sockets.
raw-sockets wraps some C++ code that exposes to use the ability to pass to the `socket` syscall
the `SOCK_RAW` option.



# Debugging
After trying to install `raw-socket` on node v13.3.0 I recieved the following error:

```
> node-gyp rebuild

No receipt for 'com.apple.pkg.DeveloperToolsCLILeo' found at '/'.

After googling the error: `No Xcode or CLT version detected` I was directed to a github comment to attempt the following `xcode-select --install` but got this:

```
xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates
```

In that same thread it was was suggested to uninstall and re-install xcode, which solved my issue ðŸŽ‰:

```
sudo rm -rf $(xcode-select -print-path)
xcode-select --install
```
