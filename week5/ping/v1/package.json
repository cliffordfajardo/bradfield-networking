I decided to implement a basic version of `ping` first, since it's a smaller scoped program, before diving into builing my implementation of `traceroute`, which is similar to `ping`, but it does more like counting the # of hops between my desitination and reporting it back to me, whereas ping doesn't include the # of hops to my destination.",
